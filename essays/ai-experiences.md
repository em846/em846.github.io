## I. Introduction

With the advancement of AI such as ChatGPT, most classrooms have banned the use of the technology in completing assignments; however, in UH Manoa's ICS 314 class of Fall 2023, the use of AI is instead encouraged. This is due to its relevance in this class as well as study into its usage and usefulness in software development, including but not limited to writing code, problem solving, and finding definitions quickly. The AI tool I'm most familiar with is ChatGPT.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

The following is a list of the course elements from 314 where AI could have been used and my experience with AI in that element:

#### 1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

I chose not to use AI for this element; I felt the materials given to me were enough for me to learn the concepts. If I did not understand something, I simply looked it up on my own. I heard from a classmate that ChatGPT often gave answers that made the task more confusing.

#### 2. In-class Practice WODs

As this assignment wasn't time sensitive and we were paired up with someone else, I did not use ChatGPT and problem-solved with my partner. We often caught each other's errors. My partner did use ChatGPT a few times, but the result often focused only on one portion of the problem, which would involve changing other parts of our code to accommodate for the code the AI gave, and thus I felt it was not a good answer at the time.

#### 3. In-class WODs

Speed here was important, unlike practice WODs, but I still chose to not use AI due to the unhelpful responses I've experienced from ChatGPT. I found it more helpful to have my own references open and to read them myself so I understood it on my terms, even if it took longer. I actually tended to finish faster than a friend who would use ChatGPT. Most of my issues with AI is that it is not aware of other parts of my code that may be relevant. I wonder if I would have a different experience using something like CoPilot.

#### 4. Essays

I hadn't even considered using AI to help me write essays as an idea or option. I tend to like writing and the process of it. It's not something I feel the need to seek assistance for besides proofreading which I believe should be done by a person to properly assess effectiveness in delivering a point or idea to other people.

#### 5. Final project

A team member of mine had used ChatGPT to come up with the name of our team and project application that was concise and relevant.

#### 6. Learning a concept / tutorial

I tend to refer to the readings, articles, and official documentation given in class modules. If I needed further help, I watched videos on YouTube made by FreeCodeCamp, a resource this class has used for learning the basics of JavaScript but has many more videos on many other coding-related topics. Again, I had 

#### 7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

Same as the previous element, I referred to materials given to me and often wrote down things my professor had said.

#### 8. Asking or answering a smart-question

I feel this plays off the previous two elements, and since I did not use AI for either, it means I cannot mention that I used AI in trying to troubleshoot.

#### 9. Coding example e.g. "give an example of using Underscore .pluck"

My WOD partner entered a prompt very similar to this into ChatGPT. The example given back was one that is provided in Underscore's documentation, so it was not particularly helpful.

#### 10. Explaining code

Continuing from the previous element, the explanation ChatGPT gave was also difficult to understand, using jargon unfamiliar to either of us at the time, despite me understanding the concept my partner was searching for. It felt like asking an industry professional, and that professional was assuming it was talking back to another professional, which it wasn't.

#### 11. Writing code

Referring to the second element on this list, it did not help write code very much due to how it felt like the code it gave me did not fall very well in with what I had already written. It did at times give me good ideas or alternatives that do work with what I already have.

#### 12. Documenting code

I have no experience in this, as I do not use CoPilot, but I figure it would help me figure out how to describe the processes going on in my code a lot better than what I have going on right now, which is bare bones at best.

#### 13. Quality assurance e.g. "What's wrong with this code `code here`" or "Fix the ESLint errors in `code here`"

I have not tried this before due to thinking that it was important to know how to read error messages. It has gotten me out of trouble many times now, and I think it's a valuable skill to have. There could even be a possibility that the code that is entered into the AI prompt isn't the source of an error.

#### 14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

I cannot think of where else I have used AI that is outside of these mentioned 13 elements.

## III. Impact of Learning and Understanding

Personally, AI has not affected my learning experience. I'm learning more and more as time passes the importance of building connections with others and learning how and where to ask for help. That also comes paired with the specific environment software engineering and perhaps computer science has of having to ask "smart" questions as to prevent asking unnecessary questions that could be left unanswered. I could see in this instance that AI can be an intermediary that is capable of answering those questions. Although, again, I keep choosing to look them up myself.

## IV. Practical Applications

I think AI can be used to jumpstart ideas. Back when my team was first starting to brainstorm our idea for the final project of this class, we had a very general idea of what our application wanted to achieve and it had no name. When my team member had given it a name through the use of ChatGPT, I feel that accelerated our work toward a more tangible goal. I have also seen other teams use AI generated images in their applications, such as for creating page mockups and their logo, which was an interesting idea and made their project appear polished.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

Again, with AI, the code ChatGPT provided felt like it didn't fit perfectly into the code I had already written and it used code that I was unfamiliar with, so copy and pasting was not an option for me personally out of fear that the part I didn't understand would come back to bite me later. However, I did not use CoPilot, which could have resulted in a more positive experience than this. One thing I did not analyze about ChatGPT was what sort of input it was given, since most of my experience has been hear-say from peers. 

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching methods only work as well as how well a teacher is able to teach. I think the same could be said with AI-enhanced approaches.

## VII. Future Considerations

I think AI could be a good tool to test students' understanding of a subject by assessing their use of AI. Also, in class, it has been interesting seeing the results that it gives for a topic in order to facilitate discussion. However, I do not think it should be the sole thing a student relies on to learn concepts, as I have heard it is prone to giving misinformation. For example, in ICS 314, we are free to use AI in assignments, but we must be able to judge whether what the AI generates is useful, relevant, or even true.

## VIII. Conclusion

As someone who is very much a creature of habit, I appreciated that there were options to and not to use AI. I have grown too used to looking things up myself. I think the way AI can be used in this class now is very helpful to those who know how to utilize it.
