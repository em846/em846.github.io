I have an uncle who is an electrical engineer, and it's always seemed like he can fix anything, or could figure out the cause of any problem, including software problems. It was fascinating and overwhelming all at once asking him about his thought process. It reminds me of how in the show Star Trek, the character Montgomery Scott, the Enterprise's chief engineer, is referred to as a "miracle worker."

I think my interest in software development stemmed from this curiosity: how did my uncle almost magically know what was wrong or how to accomplish a task? I want to understand how things work, how I can solve problems, how to perform tasks easier or more efficiently or in a very specific way, but through the lens of software engineering. Furthermore, code itself seems engimatic in its intangible nature existing right beyond the screen and out of view compared to other kinds of engineering, which makes it more compelling to me.

Now, as I begin studying software engineering, it feels like I've begun to scratch the surface of understanding the kind of problem solving skills my uncle utilizes and had been explaining to me. I wish to further develop this skill and look forward to figuring out what kinds of situations I can apply it to.
