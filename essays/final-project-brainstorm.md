## Overview:

The problem: There are many campus events held throughout the school year, but hearing about it or making the event known may be a difficult or simply troublesome task. The UH Manoa website does have a page that lists all upcoming events, but it is presented in a long dense list only sorted by date. Sometimes events are not associated with a particular department and cannot be easily searched.

The solution: A dedicated Campus Events application can help not only organize and categorize upcoming events to make searching for them easier, but can also connect students who are going to the same event and encourage connection.

## Approach:

Campus Events will have three user roles: normal users, event coordinators, and admins. Normal users can browse events that are of interest to them. Event coordinators can create new events to promote to users. Admins oversee events and posts for inappropriate or harmful content.

Events can be filtered by interest, department, and/or location for more precise search. Users can utilize these filters to find events catered to them. They can also "join" events to show that they are attending. This is for the purpose of connectivity between students.

Possible mockup pages include:
- Landing page
- User home page
- Event coordinator home page
- Admin home page
- Search/filter page

## Use case ideas:

Here are some ways users of this application may navigate it.

- New user visits landing page, logs in, sees home page, sets up a profile.
- Event coordinator creates a profile, creates a new event with a location, topics/interest, and brief description.
- User logs in, uses filters to look for events, signs up for an event.

## Beyond the basics:

There are a few extra features this application could have beyond what was already mentioned.

- Interactive map to show the location of an event.
- Rating of past events.
- Event history on user profiles.
