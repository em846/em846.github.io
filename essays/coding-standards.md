## Saying "Hello" in a new language

It becomes obvious why coding languages are called languages when picking them up. There's vocabulary to remember, such as reserved words, and a grammar structure, or syntax. Also, like human languages, different coding languages can perform the same task while sounding, or in this case looking, wildly different from each other. I think a coding standard can help keep things straight and tidy, which not only helps in learning a new language but also maintaining and fixing things previously written.

## Grammar versus intonation

I like rules, and I like it even more when they make sense and are consistent. Syntax has rules, and they need to be followed for code to work as it's intended to. However, when it comes down to getting from point A to point B, there's a number of different ways to do it.

Imagine, when writing code, choosing a random number of spaces to indent every time, or simply not indenting. Imagine writing all code on the same line. Imagine having variables named "a," "b," "c," et cetera. Sure, the computer will know what the code says and is doing, as long as the syntax was followed. However, it would be awful for a human to parse with nothing visually or intuitively grouping and linking anything together. This is where I think syntax and a coding standard differ, as one is for the machine and the other is for the human.

But why does it matter that a human understands it? If the code works, that should be it, right? Well, no, it matters because humans are writing the code, and if there's an error or bug in the code, or even if there are simply improvements to be made, those humans have to be able to read the code to understand the problem and change it. This doesn't just apply to groups of people working on a project, but even a solo developer. It's like when you write memos to yourself that you don't even understand later on; similarly, it would be preferable to not have to wrestle with and question your past-self's coding decisions.

## Cleaning up

Lately, I have been using the linting tool ESLint to clean up my code, and I don't think it's a hassle at all. In fact, I appreciate that it's very low effort in that it will fix the errors for me and how memorizing the standard isn't something that takes up that little extra brain power while I'm typing. Also, it makes my code nice and presentable so I don't have to worry about making a fool of myself in front of my peers.

In conclusion, I really like coding standards. I like organization, consistency, and good communication, and using coding standards achieves those things.
