I recall being told that if I knew one programming language, learning others would be easy. So far, this has been accurate, and continues to be as I am learning Javascript for the first time. However, I feel like my snail's pace style of thinking and learning code has boosted to rocket speed.

## What was I expecting?

Coming from Java and C++, Javascript feels as though it has many shortcuts. For example, I'm not used to the idea that functions can be treated as objects and often, out of habit, use variables where they're not needed.

I imagine that this could possibly impact my coding habits in the future if I return to Java or C++, but I think this is more so a net positive in terms of learning new ways to solve problems.

On top of this, the class in which I am using Javascript, ICS 314, also feels very fast-paced. The "athletic software engineering" puts me in a extremely focused mode where speed becomes a priority alongside being able to solve a problem presented to me.

I appreciate that the goals are clear, allowing me to zero in on what needs to be done and how, where in the past I'd often dawdle on thinking about possible methods. It's made me notice that I'm not the most efficient coder, but hopefully that will change as time passes and I put in more practice.

## Is the snail okay?

To take the snail metaphor to the extreme here, it's wearing a helmet and is strapped in. Yes, the rocket is fast and a little stressful, but I hope the trip will most likely be a safe and successful one as well as take it to its destination.
