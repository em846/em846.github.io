  <h2 id="progress-report">Progress Report</h2>

<p>Diving into what software engineering is and learning the general ideas of it all the past 4 months has been an interesting time of challenges in trying to understand what exactly software engineering is and what parts of it I was using in this class, ICS 314, even though the assignments mostly were web development. However, the point was that those ideas were applied, even in web development, and can be applied elsewhere. After all the past 4 months of studying, I hope to demonstrate I do have a stronger grasp of the fundamental ideas than I had at the start of this journey.</p>

<h2 id="learning-management">Learning Management</h2>

<p>Before this class, the extent to which I understood working with code had the scope of one person working on it, that being me. I had little conception of what working with a group of people would look like or how it would operate. From the outside, coding seems like a very independent task, and to some degree it is, but coding is only a piece of a larger picture that is creating and finishing a product.</p>

<p>In this class, I’ve been hardwired to think that making even one mistake is inexcusable; if this were a real-life situation, a mistake could have devastating consequences. The thought of someone (potentially me) updating some code and having something wrong with it deeply concerned me at first: how can you catch something like that, and how do you reverse it if it’s already been incorporated into the code? One answer is configuration management. The extent of my experience with this is Github. When working in a team, my team members and I are able to see and track changes that were made and roll back changes to an earlier version of our code to investigate an error while ensuring we still have something presentable in the meantime.</p>

<p>I also had the vague idea that in teams, everyone is assigned something to work on, and they split up to do them and occasionally check back in for updates. Yes, it is this way, but often not as simple as it seems, as large portions of code often weave together and are dependent on each other in a way that completely independent work is not possible as I had imagined it. This is where issue management in project management is handy. It determines a handful of smaller issues for the team to tackle, organized by prioritization and steps small enough to be done in a day or two, and monitored by the team as a whole. The team I had worked with had struggled to prioritize and order our issues and tasks, often aiming to do as many things simultaneously at once in an attempt to save time, when now, looking back, it had only cost us time.</p>

<p>That being said, this type of management and workflow can be applied even when working alone on personal projects. They would definitely provide a sense of organization and structure to projects, and having those things wouldn’t harm any project, I think. It’s helpful to have the option of returning to a previous version of a project if I choose to take a change in direction from a point. Breaking down tasks and putting them in order is always a good idea, and it gives me the nice feeling of being able to see things getting done over time rather than have one big looming goal that seemingly never gets done.</p>

<p>Overall, it seems the intent of these methods is that they should be improving work on a project if used correctly and well. It makes me wonder if I can take these ideas to projects that do not involve software engineering.</p>
