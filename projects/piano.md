As of 2023, I have been learning and playing piano for 12 years. The following are my performance experiences over that time.

### Recitals

I started learning by attending private lessons from Momoko Maniscalco and have participated in 6 of her recitals. As a student of Professor Jessica Choi, the piano professor at Leeward Community College, I will perform at 4 of her recitals as of the end of 2023.

Recitals by both these teachers are small showcases that allow their students the opportunity to share their efforts and growth as pianists to their peers and families.

### Japan-America Society of Hawai'i (JASH)

JASH annually holds a fundraising dinner event for their organization. Speakers at this event include former governor David Ige and former governor George Ariyoshi. I have performed at these events as dinner entertainment in the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018.

### Pau Hana - Ballet Accompanist

The performing arts at Leeward Community College have a semester-end showcase of performances by their students called Pau Hana. I was given the opportunity to work with ballet teacher Mareva Minerbi and her introductory ballet class as their live piano accompaniment for the Fall 2020 and Fall 2022 Pau Hana.

### Opening of Ho'ikeakea Gallery

In May 2023, Leeward Community College held an event commemorating the opening of Ho'ikeakea Gallery, the college's own gallery for local art. I performed as live entertainment for before the opening ceremony.
