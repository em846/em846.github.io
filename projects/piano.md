Music has familiarized me with the importance of rigorous practice paired with purposeful and intentional action. As of 2023, I have been learning and playing piano for 12 years. My performance experience includes:

- Japan-America Society of Hawai'i (JASH) annual party in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018 as entertainment
- 2018 Aloha International Piano Competition, Amateur division participant
- 3 recitals held by LCC's Professor Choi
- LCC's Fall 2020 and Fall 2022 Pau Hana for Beginning Ballet, accompanist
- Opening of LCC's Ho'ikeakea Gallery in May 2023, as entertainment
