Ka Mana'o is LCC's student-run magazine, and as their layout designer for the Spring 2018 and Fall 2018 publications, I learned more about teamwork, communication, and graphic design.

During this time, I was lucky enough to have gotten the opportunity to go to a graphic design workshop held at Chaminade University, which covered the functions and uses of industry standard applications such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe InDesign, the last being an app I used as a layout designer to put together the magazine pages in a pleasing, cohesive, and readable manner.
