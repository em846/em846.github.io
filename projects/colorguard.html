  <h1 class="display-4">Colorguard Leadership</h1>
 <p>I was my high schoolâ€™s color guard captain for three years. During this time, I acquired leadership and management skills as well as learned more about teamwork and coordination.</p>

<p>Being able to use practice hours in an effective and efficient manner was crucial in order to have enough time to teach the guard members new choreography, be on time to full-band field practice, and have an appropriate amount of breaks in between. This also meant developing organizational skills, such as time management and keeping track of supplies such as first-aid and flag equipment, to keep practice running smoothly.</p>

<p>During this time was also when I had learned more about working with others; not just as a captain to the guard, but as someone working with other section leaders and working under the band director. I learned that gaining respect from others meant not just being confident and assertive in my words and actions, but also building camaraderie with and within my team. Communication with my peers was vital to ensuring that everything ran smoothly. I aimed to address and resolve problems we faced on the field with understanding and focus on the goal.</p>
