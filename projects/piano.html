  <h1 class="display-4">Pianist</h1>
 <p>As of 2023, I have been learning and playing piano for 12 years. The following are my performance experiences over that time.</p>

<h3 id="recitals">Recitals</h3>

<p>I started learning by attending private lessons from Momoko Maniscalco and have participated in 6 of her recitals. As a student of Professor Jessica Choi, the piano professor at Leeward Community College, I will perform at 4 of her recitals as of the end of 2023.</p>

<p>Recitals by both these teachers are small showcases that allow their students the opportunity to share their efforts and growth as pianists to their peers and families.</p>

<h3 id="japan-america-society-of-hawaii-jash">Japan-America Society of Hawai’i (JASH)</h3>

<p>JASH annually holds a fundraising dinner event for their organization. Speakers at this event include former governor David Ige and former governor George Ariyoshi. I have performed at these events as dinner entertainment in the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018.</p>

<h3 id="pau-hana---ballet-accompanist">Pau Hana - Ballet Accompanist</h3>

<p>The performing arts at Leeward Community College have a semester-end showcase of performances by their students called Pau Hana. I was given the opportunity to work with ballet teacher Mareva Minerbi and her introductory ballet class as their live piano accompaniment for the Fall 2020 and Fall 2022 Pau Hana.</p>

<h3 id="opening-of-hoikeakea-gallery">Opening of Ho’ikeakea Gallery</h3>

<p>In May 2023, Leeward Community College held an event commemorating the opening of Ho’ikeakea Gallery, the college’s own gallery for local art. I performed as live entertainment for before the opening ceremony.</p>
